# Virtual Dice
1) Start program using main.py
2) Enter parameters of your throw:
    ### xDy+z

    - y – type of dice (ex. D6, D10),
    - x – numbers of throws; if you throw once you can skipp it.
    - z – the number to add (or subtract) from the result of the rolls (optional).
    
    examples:
    
    - 2D10+10: 2 throws D10, add 10 to the result
    - D6: regular throw of a six-sided dice
    - 2D3: throwing two three-sided dice,
    - D12-1: throw dice D12, subtract 1 from the result.
3) Regular types of dice in games: D3, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100. But you can use any (even one sided)
4) To exit the program type "exit"
5) Have fun!
